# 0x02. Javascript - Web scraping


## Learning objectives

* Working with JSON data
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use `request` and fetch API
* How to read and write a file using the `fs` module


**Notes:** The requessts module was depreciated in February of 2020 - and a replacement
is in the works - however, it's a simple and powerful module for practicing web scraping
in JavaScript, that is still used a lot in the industry.
