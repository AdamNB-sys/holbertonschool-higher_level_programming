Learning objectives:

* What are sets and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionaries and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate over a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What are the map, reduce, and filter functions


Tasks:

0. Squared simple

    Write a function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix.
    * Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`

1. Search and replace

    Write a function that replaces all occurrances of an element by another
    in a new list.
    * Prototype: `def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):`

2. Unique addition

    Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list.
    * Prototype: `def uniq_add(my_list=[]):`

3. Present in both

    Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
    * Prototype: `def common_elements(set_1, set_2):`

4. Only differents

    Write a function that returns a set of all elements in only one set.
    * Prototype: `def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):`

5. Number of keys

    Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
    * Prototype: `def number_keys(a_dictionary):`

6. Print sorted dictionary

    Write a function that prints a dictionary ordered by keys.
    * Prototype: `def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):`

7. Update dictionary

    Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary
    * Prototype: `def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):`

8. Simple delete by key

    Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
    * Prototype: `def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):`

9. Multiply by 2

    Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied
    by 2.
    * Prototype: `def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):`

10. Best score

    Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
    * Prototype: `def best_score(a_dictionary):`

11. Multiply by using map

    Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by
    another number without using any loops.
    * Prototype: `def multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0):`

12. Roman to integer

    Technical interview preparation:

    * You are not allowed to google anything
    * Whiteboard first

    Create a function `def roman_to_int(roman_string):` that converts a 
    Roman numeral to an integer.
