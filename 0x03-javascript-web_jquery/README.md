# 0x03 JavaScript - Web jQuery


## Learning Objectives

* "Why jQuery makes front-end programming easy" (I despise coding front-end anything)
* How to select HTML elements in JavaScript
* How to select HTML elements in jQuery
* What are the differences between `ID`, `class` and `tag name` selectors
* How to modify the style of an HTML element
* How to get and update the content of an HTML element
* How to modify the DOM
* How to make a `GET` request with jQuery Ajax
* How to make a `POST` request with jQuery Ajax
* How to listen/bind DOM events

*Notes:* I absolutely despise front-end development. I couldn't care less about HTML or CSS, 
and every time I see functions written into HTML I want to vomit because it's so disgusting.
I'm hoping that this project makes me hate this sort of thing less, but I can't wait for the
day when I don't have to develop web pages anymore.
